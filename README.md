# Principal-Component-Analysis-with-Covid-Data

In this project, principal component analysis (PCA) is performed from scratch to reduce dimensionality of pandemic time-series data and perform data reconstruction. In the end, the customized PCA is applied to the open-source MNIST dataset to perform image reconstruction. The effect of the number of principal components used is investigated by comparing the quality of reconstructed images when different number of principal components is used.
